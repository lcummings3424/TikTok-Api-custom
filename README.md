This api is designed to **retrieve data** TikTok. It **can not be used post or upload** content to TikTok on the behalf of a user. It has **no support for any user-authenticated routes**, if you can't access it while being logged out on their website you can't access it here.

## Quick Start Guide

Here's a quick bit of code to get the most recent trending videos on TikTok. There's more examples in the [examples](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/tree/main/examples) directory.

**Note:** If you want to learn how to web scrape websites check my [free and open-source course for web scraping](https://github.com/davidteather/web-scraping-with-reverse-engineering)

```py
from TikTokApi import TikTokApi
import asyncio
import os

ms_token = os.environ.get("ms_token", None) # get your own ms_token from your cookies on tiktok.com

async def trending_videos():
    async with TikTokApi() as api:
        await api.create_sessions(ms_tokens=[ms_token], num_sessions=1, sleep_after=3, browser=os.getenv("TIKTOK_BROWSER", "chromium"))
        async for video in api.trending.videos(count=30):
            print(video)
            print(video.as_dict)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(trending_videos())
```

To directly run the example scripts from the repository root, use the `-m` option on python.

```sh
python -m examples.trending_example
```

You can access the full data dictionary the object was created from with `.as_dict`. On a video this may look like
[this](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/7c30780bbc30772ba11ec9e0b909e99d). TikTok changes their structure from time to time so it's worth investigating the structure of the dictionary when you use this package.
